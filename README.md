 - A2: Low-Level Programming and Data Structures
 - A3: Modern Object Oriented and Funcional Languages
 - A4: Frontend Development
 - A5: Network and Security
 - A6: Software Engineering
 - A7: IA, Machine Learning and Deep Learning

### Test Stages

 - S1: Concept Test with 30 multiple choice questions (45 minutes).
   - Quenstions about the seven tested areas.
   - Five alternatives per question.
   - Any questions can be about more of one tested area.
   - The alternatives have not binary evaluation.
 - S2: Pratical Test with 4 code questions (1 hour)
   - Question in diversal languages.
   - Visual probelam representation.
   - Cover by hidden automated testes.
   - The third is a performance question.
   - The fourth is a IA, Machine Learning and Deep Learning question.
   - Avaliated by test result;
 - S3: Open Problem Solving (45 hour)
   - A open problem, with many solutions and interpretations.
   - All resources are allowed.
   - Some security or network aspect.
   - Simple library and tool will be delivered.
 - S4: Pratical Bug Fix with 4 code questions (1 hour)
   - Levels easy to insane.
   - Visual probelam representation.
   - Cover by hidden automated testes.
   - The fourth question about interface question.
   - Avaliated by test result;

### Grade

   - G1 = (S1 grade about Pure Logic and Math + S2 + S4) / 3
   - G2 = (S1 grade about Low-Level Programming and Data Structures + S2 third question) / 2
   - G3 = (S1 grade about Modern Object Oriented and Funcional Languages + S3) / 2
   - G4 = (S1 grade about Frontend Development + S4 fourth question) / 2
   - G5 = (S1 grade about Network and Security + S3 network/security aspect) / 2
   - G6 = (S1 grade about Software Engineering + S3) / 2
   - G7 = (S1 grade about IA, Machine Learning and Deep Learning + S4 fourth question) / 2

Final grade = (G1 + G2 + G3 + G4 + G5 + G6 + G7) / 2 (Between 0 and 1000)
